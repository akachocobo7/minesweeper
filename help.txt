There are several landmines in the field.
If you open the cell where the land mine exists, you lose.
It will win if we open all cells where no land mine exists.
Enter "1 y x" to open the cell in the y-th row and the x-th column.
You can enter "2 y x" to mark the cell in row y x column
so that you do not accidentally open it.
